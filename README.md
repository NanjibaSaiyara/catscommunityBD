<p><h2> Community Cat" is an umbrella definition that includes any un-owned cats. These cats may be "feral" (unsocialized) or friendly, may have been born into the wild, or may be lost or abandoned pet cats.
Many Community Cats are cared for by compassionate people, who provide food and water for these cats. Others thrive without any human intervention, especially in our temperate climate. They live in neighborhoods, shopping centers, commercial properties and near dumpsters - anywhere they can find shelter. Whatever a cat's individual circumstances, the term "Community Cat" reflects the reality that for these cats, "home" is within the community rather than in an individual household. For these cats however, overpopulation remains their biggest threat.
The Humane Society promotes Trap/Neuter/ Return (TNR), which has proven to be the most effective, humane method of reducing Community Cat populations. Through TNR, these cats are humanely trapped, vaccinated, microchiped, neutered, ear-tipped, and returned to outdoor homes to live out their lives.</p> </h1>
